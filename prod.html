                    <p>
                        As a Full-Stack Developer Intern at Prodisphere, an early-stage sports NIL valuation startup, I was tasked with building the company’s flagship marketing website entirely from the ground up. This project was a full-spectrum learning experience where I owned everything from ideation to execution.
                        <br><br>
                        <!-- I conducted UX research and translated insights into wireframes and high-fidelity designs using Figma, collaborating closely with the founder to align on the product vision. While we had regular calls to iterate on direction, I was ultimately responsible for making key design and development decisions.
                        <br><br>
                        I built the landing page using React, TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, ensuring it was performant, responsive, and scalable for future growth. The site was deployed via Vercel, and early revisions were tracked collaboratively through a shared feedback document.
                        <br><br>
                        This project pushed me to think critically about real-world user experience, frontend architecture, and the end-to-end web development process. It marked my first time shipping a complete website to production that will represent a live business and engage actual users. -->

                    <h2 style="font-size: 40px">Problem</h2>
                    <p>Prodisphere previously outsourced their website development, but the result lacked flexibility, design polish, and long-term maintainability. 
                        As the company’s vision and branding began to solidify, they needed a modern, in-house solution that better reflected their identity; one that could 
                        evolve quickly with the product and be managed internally.</p>

                    <p>My design process began with thorough initial research, where I explored a wide variety of sports valuation 
                        and analytics websites to gather inspiration. I focused on how these platforms structured their landing pages, 
                        the language they used, and how they visually communicated trust and authority. With these insights, I conducted 
                        further UX research and translated our findings into wireframes and high-fidelity designs using Figma. This was a 
                        collaborative effort, involving close work with the founder to align on the product vision; however, while we 
                        had regular calls to iterate on direction, I was ultimately responsible for making key design and development decisions.

                <p>
                My internship at Prodisphere has been a pivotal experience in my development journey. Leading the creation of the company's first marketing website from concept to launch provided me with immense hands-on experience in a dynamic startup environment. 
                This project was my first venture into shipping a production-level website for a real business, which taught me the importance of not just technical execution, but also clear communication, adaptability, and understanding business goals.
                <br><br>
                Working directly with the founder, translating vision into tangible designs in Figma, and then bringing those designs to life with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS was incredibly rewarding. I honed my skills in full-stack development, UX/UI design, and agile project management using Jira. Setting the technical foundation for future development was a responsibility I valued, and it pushed me to focus on creating scalable and maintainable code.
                <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 800; color: var(--f1-color); font-size: 32px;">Establishing Prodisphere's visual identity</span><br>
                I learned the importance of maintaining proper design principles.  Establishing set heading sizes, defining a consistent color palette, and carefully selecting typefaces are not just aesthetic choices; they are the foundation of a scalable and maintainable design system. This ensures a consistent brand identity, improves user experience, and makes future development more efficient.
                <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 800; color: var(--f1-color); font-size: 32px;">Creating reusable React components</span><br>
                Since I was laying down the foundation of Prodisphere's website, it was important that I create reusable components whenever I can. Doing this allows me and future Prodisphere developers to efficiently update the website, saving time and ensuring design consistencies.
                <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: 800; color: var(--f1-color); font-size: 32px;">Utilizing Git version control</span><br>
                    Using Git for version control, especially with a branching strategy, was crucial. It provided a safety net to experiment 
                    with new features without risking the stability of the main codebase and streamlined the process of managing changes. Before this internship, I was unfamiliar with Git, and the thought of using it scared me. 
                    However, after merging branches multiple times, countless git pushes, and accidentally overwriting some of my code, I am much more comfortable with the software.
                <br><br>
                This project solidified my passion for building user-centric web applications and tackling the unique challenges presented by early-stage ventures. I am incredibly appreciative of the opportunity the Prodisphere team gave me to build their platform from the ground up. I am eager to apply what I've learned and continue to be a part of Prodisphere's journey.
